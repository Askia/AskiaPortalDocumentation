Exporting and sharing your analyses
-----------------------------------

Askiavista offers several ways to share and export your tables and charts:

-   Download your table/chart results in Microsoft Excel format (xlsx). This procedure is covered below.
-   [Save one or more analyses to a portfolio](#), then download the entire portfolio it in Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx). See [export portfolio](#).
-   [Save one or more analyses to a portfolio](#), then share the portfolio with other askiavista users. See [sharing portfolios with clients and co-workers](#).
-   [Save one or more analyses to a portfolio](#), then share a link to the portfolio; recipients do not need to be askiavista users to view the contents of the portfolio. See [sharing portfolios with clients and co-workers](#).
-   Include your table/chart results in an external portal or web page by [embedding the HTML code](#).

*To download individual table/chart results to Microsoft Excel:*

1.  Set up your table definition to your liking.
2.  Set the property `all in a single page` to your liking; if it is selected, then the analyses will be included on the same Excel sheet. If it is *not* selected, then separate pages of the analyses will be placed onto separate Excel sheets. This property can be found in the [general tab](#) of the table properties.
3.  Above the crosstab preview, click `Export to MS Excel (*. xlsx)`.
4.  Depending on your browser settings, the file may be saved automatically to your downloads folder, or you may be prompted to specify a location for the file.
