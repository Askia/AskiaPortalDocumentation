Embedding your results in an external web page or portal
--------------------------------------------------------

Askiavista makes it easy to embed your tables and charts into external web pages (could they be dashboards, reports or portals). You can access the underlying JavaScript code, and then copy and paste it into the external resource (generally, one or more HTML pages). When the underlying data changes, the results displayed in the external page will be updates accordingly.

*To embed your results in an external web page or portal:*

1.  Set up your table definition to your liking.
2.  Above the crosstab preview, click `Source code`. The source code is displayed in a pop-up window.
3.  Press **CTRL+A** (on Mac OS ![](http://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/ks_command.png)**+A**) to select all of the source code.
4.  Press **CTRL+C** (on Mac OS, **![](http://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/ks_command.png)+C**) to copy the source code to the clipboard.
5.  Click anywhere else in the askiavista interface to close the source code window.
6.  You can now paste the source code into an external web page. The method you should use varies according to the software you are using to maintain the external resource; please see the software's documentation for details.
