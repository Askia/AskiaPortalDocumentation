# About AskiaVista

AskiaVista is a powerful online analysis tool, providing you and your clients with real-time data online, at any time. 

It allows you to create and save sophisticated analyses, allowing your clients easy access to receive up-to-the-minute counts and cross-tabs.

What's more, its intuitive interface allows your clients to create and save their own analyses.

You can control and create different access rights for individual users, whether that’s giving them access to certain surveys, questions, sub-populations, calculated variables or weightings.

AskiaVista is a fully web-compliant application that runs on any modern browser under any operating system. Supported browsers include:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 9 (_and above_)

Because AskiaVista uses modern web standards, it does not support legacy browsers, such as IE 8 or lower.

If you are using an older browser, you will need to update it before using AskiaVista.
