# User administration

Administration is a Portal Module that allows an administrator to manage their Askia platform.


## Invite a new user to join the platform

### Create Bob's user profile

Hit **Users** then **Add user** to reach the user creation form. 
Fill in the details and a temporary password. 


!!! Info
    When the user will first connect to the platform, they will be prompted to reset their password
    
Now to the fun part.

Add this user to one or multiple **groups**. This will allow them to collaborate in a team, and share resources with multiple colleagues without explicitely name them. When you select groups, you will notice the **Available surveys** list changing. This reflects surveys that are currently shared with a specific group of users. As soon as the user is created, they will have access to these surveys.

### Apply role

Roles are a way to apply user preferences to multiple users at once.
Select the **Data Analysts** role from the list, which we have created previously

### Admin duties for Bob ?

Click the **Admin access** button and allow Bob access to Administration. He will now have access to this Module and will be able to perform some management duties.
Bob's view will be limited to users that he is allowed to manage. You can choose to grant 

- Manage all groups and users : In this case, Bob will see everyone on this platform
- Add one or multiple groups to Bob's list of **Managed groups** : Bob will see all these users.

With the **Access to Groups**, **Access to Users** and **Access to Roles** dropdowns, you can fine-tune which level of permission they have.

!!! Info
    Some options in this view might be restricted to you. The idea is that we allow you to create more users, but they cannot have permissions that you haven't been granted.


### Invite Bob to join the platform

Once Bob's profile is created, you will be prompted to invite them now. If you don't, you can come back later and hit **Send invitation** from the top-left corner of the edition form.


!!! Tip
    You can create multiple users in one go from the top-right corner of the creation form.
