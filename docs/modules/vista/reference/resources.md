The `Share resource` window appears, displaying a list of the users with whom the resource is currently shared.

*To add a person to the list:*

1. Click in the text-box at the bottom of the window. A dropdown appears, containing the list of visible askiavista user accounts. The account visibility is configured in the `User settings` in askiavista's Administration view.
2. To quickly find someone in the drop-down list, start typing part of the person's name, and the list will be filtered to show the people whose names contain the letters you type.
3. Select the person from the drop-down list which appears.
4. Click `Add` (you can add several people at once if you wish; this means that if you are adding multiple people, there is no need to click `Add` after every name).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each person you want to add.
6. Click `Share`. The `Share resource` modal dialog closes.

You can remove a person from the list, which means that they lose all rights to use or change the resource.

*To remove a person from the list:*

1. In the `Share resource` modal dialog, select the person in the list.
2. Click `Remove`:
